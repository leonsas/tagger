Auto tag pocket's articles by length
====================================


Sometimes I feel like reading a long article. Sometimes I just have 3 minutes to kill and want a quick read. I found Pocket's built-in highlighted "quick reads" not very effective, so built this.

It's a simple hosted cron job to tag articles based on length. Currently hosted on Google App Engine.
